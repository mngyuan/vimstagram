vim style navigation for instagram. The core commands:

```
J - next
K - prev
L - like
```

You can also
```
C - comment
U - undo last comment
V - view all comments
R - report / embed
```

Can't see the whole posts? Zoom out with `Ctrl+` or `âŒ˜+`.

This extension was made out of my love for Instagram.
If you have suggestions for new features, please let me know in the [issues](https://github.com/phorust/vimstagram/issues)!
